UkuleleTuner
============

A Microchip PIC-based Ukulele Tuner<br>
<br>
This is a standard 4-string soprano ukulele tuner that tunes the following 4 notes at their respective 
frequencies: G (392 Hz), C (262 Hz), E (330 Hz), A (440 Hz). The electronic tuner includes a 
microphone to listen to sound inputs (ideally from a ukulele string), a LED segment display to 
show one of four notes (G, C, E, A), and a set of red/green LEDs to guide the pitch if it is low, 
high, or correct. At the core, the tuner uses a Microchip PIC16F877 microcontroller, coupled with amplifying and 
filtering circuitries, to process the sound inputs, do the calculations, and to output the results.
